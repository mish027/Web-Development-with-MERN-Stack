#### Protocol:  
    Set of rules/instructions  
        http: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol  
        https: Hyper text Transfer Protocol Secure    
        tcp: Transmission Control Protocol  
        udp: User Datagram Protocol  
        smtp: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  (gmail if no subject, alert)  
        ftp: File Transfer Protocol (same file names not allowed)  
        ip: Internet Protocol (ipv4 & ipv6) (smart AC -> ip address)
            -> Client/Web Page ------------(uName & uPwd) -----------> Instagram Server  
            (credentials are sent through the network)  
            
            -> 3rd party who watches communication btw client and servers  
            they can easily get these credentials and hack misuse our apps Bank/apps.  
            Inorder to avoid this, https->data tranferred will be secure.  
            educational sites public -> http is okay  
            -> SSL certification (Secure Socket Layer Certification)
