    <p><b>Data science</b> is an interdisciplinary academic fields<sup>[1]</sup> that uses statistics,<mark> scientific computing,</mark> <del>scientific</del> methods, <em>processing, scientific </em>visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from potentially noisy, <strong>structured,</strong> or unstructured data.[2]<br/><br/>



    <mark><u>Data science also integrates domain knowledge from the underlying application domain</u></mark> (e.g., natural sciences, information technology, and medicine).[3] Data science is multifaceted and can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4]
    </p>
    <p>Data science is "a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, informatics, and their related methods" to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data.[5] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.[6] However, data science is different from computer science and information science. Turing Award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology" and the data deluge.[7][8]

A data scientist is a professional who creates programming code and combines it with statistical knowledge to summarize data.[9]</p>
